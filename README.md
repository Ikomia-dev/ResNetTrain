# ResNetTrain

Ikomia plugin to train ResNet image classification model. This plugin is based on [PyTorch torchvision implementation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision).

### How to use it?
Here are the steps:

1. Create Ikomia account for free [here](https://ikomia.com/accounts/signup/) (if you don't have one)
2. Install [Ikomia software](https://ikomia.com/en/download)
3. Launch the software and log in with your credentials
4. Open Ikomia Store and install ResNetTrain plugin
5. Open images folder organized in *train* and *val* subfolders 
6. Add ResNetTrain algorithm to the workflow
7. Start the workflow and evaluate the training thanks to [MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org/) integration

That's it!
